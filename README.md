# NeonRush

NeonRush is an infinite runner developed in Unity with the primary objective of practicing and strengthening core gameplay programming concepts such as procedural level generation, pickup systems, and player collision mechanics.

The game challenges players to endure increasingly difficult runs through endless sci-fi corridors, collecting energy capsules and speed boosts while surviving as long as possible.

## Project Overview
**Genre:** Endless Runner 

**Theme:** Sci-Fi

**Core Gameplay:** 
* Player runs continuously through procedurally generated environments.
* Collectible energy capsules and speed boosts provide progression and variation.
* Difficulty escalates dynamically as the player advances.
* The challenge is survival ; the further you run, the faster and more difficult it becomes
## Development Focus
This project served as a practical exercise in gameplay systems, rapid prototyping, and Unityâ€™s scripting workflow. Key areas of learning included:

* Procedural level generation
* Pickup and scoring systems
* Dynamic difficulty scaling
* Camera feedback for responsiveness
* Player collision handling
Iterative prototyping and design
